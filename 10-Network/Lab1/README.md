# Advanced Network Lab1
### 1. Install cisco packet tracer on your machine.

### 2. Draw a network diagram for ITI Building that has 2 switches connected
together (what is the cable type used for this connection?). One for staff
and the other for students each switch connected to 3 different devices.
(Hint add labels for each device on diagram).

### 3. Implement basic switch configuration:
- a. Change hostname for each switch.
- b. Secure console with password “cisco” then test it.
- c. Show vlan1 IP configuration before configured.
- d. Add Setting static IP for vlan1 then show the IP configuration
  (describe what is the steps needed for DHCP configuration for Vlan1)
- e. Add password for telnet access then try to access the privileged mode
  of the switch from one of the devices (what did you notice).
- f. Configure password for privileged mode access (must be encrypted).
- g. Try access the privileged mode again.
- h. Show running configuration on the switch.
