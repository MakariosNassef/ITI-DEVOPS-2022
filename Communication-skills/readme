The SOCIAL STYLE Model
4 SOCIAL STYLEs.
The Four SOCIAL STYLEs are 
the Driving Style, the Expressive Style, 
the Amiable Style, and the Analytical Style. 
TRACOM created the SOCIAL STYLE Model based on the four unique Styles, 
with each having different ways of using time and predictable ways of interacting and making decisions. 
With the SOCIAL STYLEs assessment, you can observe a person and determine their preferences or Style. 
You can then use that information to moderate your behavior and make that person more comfortable. This is called Versatility.
